# 🚗 Business Optimisation – Car Sales Platform (Excel Solver)

## 📋 Overview
This project optimises the assignment of car makes to different social media platforms based on turnaround time and return on investment (ROI). Using Excel’s Solver add-in, the model identifies the top 3 most effective platforms for each car make to maximise efficiency and sales impact.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Solver Add-in (for optimisation modelling)
- Conditional formatting for performance visualisation

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The company randomly assigns vehicle makes to multiple social media channels. The objective is to identify the platforms that:
- Provide the **highest ROI**
- Offer the **shortest turnaround days**

The challenge is to assign each car make to the 3 most optimal platforms using constraint-based optimisation.

## 🧮 Solution Approach
- Imported historical data on turnaround and ROI
- Used Excel Solver to set up an optimisation model
- Defined the objective function: maximise total ROI and minimise average turnaround
- Constraints included:
  - Max 3 platforms per car make
  - Minimum allocation thresholds
  - Feasible combinations only
