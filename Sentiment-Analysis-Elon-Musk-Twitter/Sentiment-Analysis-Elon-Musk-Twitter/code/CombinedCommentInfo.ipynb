The kind of software development talent at Twitter and what is required to build an operating system that integrates with mobile phone hardware and build an interconnective ecosystem of external hardware devices (smart things) is a completely different skill set. Tesla is better suited for that task, and we're still waiting for full self driving, roadster and cybertruck. They've got their hands full.  But the question remains what will cause people to leave the current systems for his? Starlink on a phone isn't realistic when you need a satellite dish.
